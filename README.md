# Styling a Chart Dashboard
This was a very early-stage project in the Team Treehouse [Front-End Web Development Tech Degree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development) program. I completed the program in 2019. [View my Certificate](https://www.credential.net/1700e85d-d29e-493d-a28e-a8c1860459c8#acc.PS7ITKNb)

The objective was to implement a given layout using Chart.js, HTML and CSS.

[Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) is an open source HTML5 chart library.

## Optimizations

- The layout page needs to be refreshed in order to see the responsive layout correctly on mobile, should refresh on resize
- Some of the color choices might not be accessible, like inactive pill sliders

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to implement charts from the chart.js library.
